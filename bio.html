    <div id='bio'>
      <p> I am an aspiring web-developer currently living in Philadelphia, PA.  After finishing undergrad and struggling to find a job I dove in to the service industry to become a bartender and make some easy money.  Fast forward 3.5 years of extremely late nights and long hours and a change was needed. Here I am starting a new chapter of my life, embarking on the daunting journey of Dev Bootcamp with the hopes of starting a new career.  This site is the beginnings of what I hope will become a fully working portfolio and gateway in to all things I've accomplished and hope to accomplish.
