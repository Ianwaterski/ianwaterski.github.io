<!--
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was good, it was really nice to have a living breathing reference there with me along the way.  If I ever had a question I could always ask my partner what their thought was.  Same goes for problem solving or lay out questions.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Absolutely, when you have something laid out to reference it makes setting up HTML a bit easier.  It can be a bit frustrating though when you can add things to your site that I don't quite know how to do.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
We kept it simple.  We decided that the blog template page should focus around the text, and navigation back to the parent blog site.  We added some rough header and footer elements as well.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
We did a bit more work on meta tags and started to research <div> tags but decided to keep it as simple as possible.
