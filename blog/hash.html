    <h1> I got my hash/array pipe </h1>


    <hr />

    <p>
    Thus far in my DBC experience nothing has been as difficult for me to wrap my head around as arrays.  Maybe iteration, but ignore that.  This week in crazy programming adventures is <strong>HASH</strong>es (eheheh) and arrays too. <em>-cue intro music-</em></br></br>

    The easiest way to understand an array is to think about it as an ordered list.  Imagine being able to tell Ruby, "Hey Ruby store these things in order in something".  Just like that you've got a numbered list of items that ruby will keep track of and you can access whenever you want.  You've got an array.  I always think of arrays as a straight line with data in slots along a number line, kind of like a storage unit you rent.  All the units are lined up by number and each individual storage unit is an index. </br></br>

    A hash on the other hand is more like a dictionary instead of an ordered list.  You tell Ruby, "Hey I have these keys that I want you to store values in.  For "Cheese" I want you to remember cheddar and for "Dog" I want you to remember Duchess".  Now you have a hash.  Instead of keeping items in an indexed list like an array, a hash keeps things organized by keys that you define as the programmer.  It makes keeping data of non listed items much easier.
  </br></br>
    In all seriousness both hashes and arrays are both very similar in that the both store data, the real difference is only in how it arranges them and then semantically how you access them.  Both could be used for the same goal but are going to be structured differently.  The crux is really finding which is the best to use for your problem at hand.
