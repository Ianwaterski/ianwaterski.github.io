    <h1> High "Class" Sass </h1>

    <hr />

    <p> Just when you thought Ruby may yield and be slightly easier, boy were you wrong!  Classes for sure make things easier, but not without taking their fair share of your patience.</br>
    The best way for me to explain what classes in Ruby are is to use an analogy.  Imagine that classes are a car.  The entire car is made up of many parts, wheels, an engine, and fuel.  All of these things make up what a car is and they all have their own specific tasks.  The same can be said for a Ruby class.  The class has an overall purpose, but is only achieved by using all the parts in side of the car.
