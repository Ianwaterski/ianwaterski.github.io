    <h1> High "Class" Sass </h1>

    <hr />

    <p> Just when you thought Ruby may yield and be slightly easier, boy were you wrong!  Classes for sure make things easier, but not without taking their fair share of your patience.</br></br>

    The best way for me to explain what classes in Ruby are is to use an analogy.  Imagine that classes are a car.  The entire car is made up of many parts, wheels, an engine, and fuel.  All of these things make up what a car is and they all have their own specific tasks.  The same can be said for a Ruby class.  The class has an overall purpose, but is only achieved by using all the parts in side of the car.  </br></br>

    The individual parts of the car can be used to describe methods in a class.  Each method has a specific job to do, for example the wheels.  It is worth noting now that it is best practice to have one method do one thing, much like the wheels do one thing.  Classes are designed to pull together many smaller tasks to achieve one big task.  Much iike a car is the assembly of all its smaller parts in order to move people, a class is an assembly of all its smaller methods in order to achieve the goal of the class.</br></br>

    This image of object hierarchy helps give a better understanding of how items work in the scheme of inheritance.
