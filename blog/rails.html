    <div id='header'> What is Rails? </div>

    <p>Rails is a software library that extendst the Ruby language. It is software code that is added to the language.  Technically it is a package library (called a RubyGem) that is installed via Terminal.</br></br>

    Rails is a framework for building websites and it sets out to establish easier conventions for collaboration and maintenance.  Rails combines Ruby with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an application that runs a web server.  As a larger idea Rails is more of a software library.  It is a community driven software project that build libraries in the hopes of simplifying the task of building complex websites.</br></br>

    What I've learned so far is that Rails is a vast software library that is driven by community involvement with the project.  Members of the community share values, support each other, and often use the same tools.  All of these things are a part of building what Rails is designed to be, a platform that makes collaboration among colleagues easier.  The reason Rails is so popular is that it makes developing complex websites much easier with the addition of RubyGems.  </br></br>

    The analogy that strikes me currently is that imagine if you were trying to brew beer.  You can individually buy all the pieces you need, probably find a recipe online somewhere, look up all the specfics for fermentation etc. but it would be a mountain of a task.  Now imagine instead you could grab a "starter kit" that would simplify a large chunk of that task with all the fermentation info, your grains, temperatures etc.  In my head that is what Rails is attempting to do with websites.  RubyGems offer simplification of complex web development problems in order to build a website quickly.  You could grab a retail store overlay, or a secure checkout form, or data management system that saves you time in development but also offers skeleton to work from for advancement.
